Hi! I'm Wang Xing, a junior year undergraduate in University of Electronic Science and Technology of China(UESTC). 

My research focuses on  machine learning, learning on graphs, and graph neural networks. Dealing with structured data  structured data makes me feel thrilled! 

I am also fascinated with innovation. UI design and software development can always inspire me. During my undergraduate years,  I worked with partners on software development, which allows us to practice skills and win national awards.
